This repository contains a modified version of the SIR epidemic model to include healthcare workers as a separate category and analyses the impact of PPE and medical equipments (ventilators) in the infection dynamics. Although, the motivation for this model was the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis, the generic nature of the model may be applied to any epidemic scenario. Scripts are written in Python using Jupiter notebooks from Conda. The notebook can be viewed using nbviewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

There are two Python3 Jupyter notebooks here:
1. SIRH Model is the simplified version with completed comments.
2. EpidemicHealthcareResourceModel is the exploration of more complex versions and has fewer comments in the notebook
