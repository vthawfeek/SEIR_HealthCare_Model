This repository contains a modified version of the SIR epidemic model to include healthcare workers as a separate category and analyses the impact of PPE and medical equipments (ventilators) in the infection dynamics. Although, the motivation for this model was the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis, the generic nature of the model may be applied to any epidemic scenario. Scripts are written in Python using Jupiter notebooks from Conda. The notebook can be viewed using nbviewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

There are two Python3 Jupyter notebooks here:
1. EpidemicHealthcareResourceModel contains various forms of SIR epidemic models considering healthcare workers, PPE and medical equipmenets. The complexity of the model increases as you progress in the notebook.
2. SIRH Model is the further exploration of parameter space of the most simplest version of model from above.
